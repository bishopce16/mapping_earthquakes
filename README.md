# **mapping_earthquakes**

Creating an interactive map of earthquakes, all over the planet for the last seven days.

## **Overview of Project:**<br>

The purpose of this project was to compile an interactive map of earthquakes, all over the planet for the last seven days. The earthquake data was retrieved from the [USGS Website](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) Earthquake data. The map can be toggled between three different map styles (streets, satellite, and dark) in the overlay control panel in the top-right corner of the map. Which also contains the three overlays available Earthquakes (all earthquakes for the past 7 days), Tectonic Plates (the tectonic plate boundaries), and Major Earthquakes (the major earthquakes for the last 7 days). To zoom in and out of the map is in the top-left corner, with the legend in the bottom-right corner of the map.<br>
